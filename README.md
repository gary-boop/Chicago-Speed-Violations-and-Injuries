# Do speed cameras reduce road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths?
Road traffic crashes are a major cause of death and disability. The speed at which a vehicle travels is an important determinant of injury; the faster the vehicle is travelling, the greater the energy inflicted on the occupants during a crash, and the greater the injury.
Excessive speed (driving faster than the posted limit or too fast for the prevailing conditions) has been found to contribute to a substantial number of crashes. If the number of speeding drivers is reduced, both the likelihood and severity of a crash will be lowered. The enforcement of safe speeds with speed cameras and associated automated devices is one such measure.
35 different studies with pre-set standard criteria were reviewed to analyze the reduction in average speeds post intervention of speed cameras. The study can be found here.
City of Chicago enforced Childrenâ€™s Safety Zone Program where enhanced signage and automated safety cameras were used to identify and ticket motorists who are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limits. The enforcement hours were 7am-7pm (Mon-Fri) around schools and 6am-11pm around parks that are open during these times.
