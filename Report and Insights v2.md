# Do speed cameras reduce road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths?

Road traffic crashes are a major cause of death and disability. The speed at which a vehicle travels is an important determinant of injury; the faster the vehicle is travelling, the greater the energy inflicted on the occupants during a crash, and the greater the injury.

Excessive speed (driving faster than the posted limit or too fast for the prevailing conditions) has been found to contribute to a substantial number of crashes. If the number of speeding drivers is reduced, both the likelihood and severity of a crash will be lowered. The enforcement of safe speeds with speed cameras and associated automated devices is one such measure.

35 different studies with pre-set standard criteria were reviewed to analyze the reduction in average speeds post intervention of speed cameras. The study can be found [here](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004607.pub4/abstract).

City of Chicago enforced Children’s Safety Zone Program where enhanced signage and automated safety cameras were used to identify and ticket motorists who are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limits. The enforcement hours were 7am-7pm (Mon-Fri) around schools and 6am-11pm around parks that are open during these times.

The above chart shows the effect of installing automated safety cameras. The chart in orange show the number of speed violations per year. The program was started in 2014 and as we can see, the violations are reducing each year. This chart verifies the effectiveness of installing speed monitoring safety cameras.

*[Datasets used for the purpose of this report comprised of Chicago [Speed Camera Violations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4) and Chicago [Traffic Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/data). The datasets were joined using the Latitude column. Since the datasets are different, their join comprised of many null values.

*Information about the chart- For the purpose of this chart, it was trimmed for years 2015-2018; years 2014 and 2019 are excluded due to incomplete data. It shows a continuous trend for each month by year. Average monthly violations are considered for each month. By using an area chart, the trend is visible more clearly. Using this area chart, the decrease in number of violations is easy to interpret]*

Even though it is evident that these cameras are effective, citizens of Chicago argue that they are unnecessarily being forced to pay fines for speed violations. Citizens argued that they were fined for violations committed outside of the Children’s Safety program time limits.

A pedestrian hit by a car traveling 20 mph – the speed in a school zone – has a 95% chance of living. That same person hit by a car traveling more than 40 mph has an 80% chance of dying.

![TotalInjuries](https://github.com/gauravhassija/Chicago-Speed-Violations-and-Injuries/blob/master/chart2.JPG)

This graph shows the Fatal and Incapacitating injuries against total injuries caused due to over speeding. The injuries are increasing every year. If more speed monitoring cameras are installed, the effect seen by installing cameras in Children Safety zone program can be replicated. There will be a reduction in the number of violations thereby decreasing the number of injuries.

*[Information about the chart- This area chart shows the increasing trend of number of injuries caused due to speed violations. By the usage of area chart, an urgency is created; appropriate steps should be taken to control this increasing number of injuries.

*This chart shows information for number of injuries for years 2015-2018. The 'Primary Contributory Cause' column was used. The column consisted of many values for each crash caused. For the purpose of this report, the following causes were selected for analysis: DISREGARDING STOP SIGN, EXCEEDING AUTHORIZED SPEED LIMIT, EXCEEDING SAFE SPEED FOR CONDITIONS and FAILING TO REDUCE SPEED TO AVOID CRASH. The values were selected because they are linked with speed violations. A new calculated column was created comprising of Fatal and Incapacitating injuries. With the values in the 'Primary Contributory Cause', the purpse was to identify the number of fatal and incapacitating injuries caused by traffic crashes due to speed violations.]*

Here is the list of top 10 places with highest injuries. The City officials should plead with the Mayor to place automated safety cameras at these locations to reduce the number of injuries. Rules and regulations should be enforced at all times of the day.

*[Information about the chart- By using a bar chart, we can see the list of locations where the injuries were highest. By showing it in a decreasing fashion, the number of injuries relative to other locations is shown which guides the Chicago City officials to identify locations for new safety cameras]*
